# BLO256-Hash
Reuploaded because I can't link this to the git terminal

Download entire file and move /src/ /bin/ and test.txt into an empty project in Eclipse.
You can optionally replace the contents of test.txt with whatever you want, for now it's my favorite IRC bot parser.

Run file as Java application
Expected output:
- Some basic startup information about what the output will be
- The lights-out grid when the process is complete
- The final 256-bit hash, written in hexadecimal
